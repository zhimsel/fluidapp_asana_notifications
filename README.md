# fluidapp_asana_notifications
Userscript for [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) that places a dock badge when there are unread Asana notifications

# Usage

1. Open your Asana fluidapp
2. In the menubar, open `Window > Userscripts`
3. Create a new userscript "class" at the bottom left, name it whatever you want ("Asana" would make sense)
4. With that class selected, create a new pattern to match `*app.asana.com`
5. Paste the contents of [userscript.js] in the text area
6. Make sure both the class and pattern are checked
7. Quit and re-open your Asana fluidapp
8. Enjoy seeing a dock badge when you have unread inbox items
